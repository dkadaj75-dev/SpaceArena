# Maps and skyboxes in Orion's Arm

A reference for building arenas (maps) and skyboxes **outside** this repo — e.g. in a
standalone Babylon.js map/planet/skybox builder — and importing the result.

Everything a map is, is **data**. There is no per-map code: the client reads an `arena.*`
JSON config plus its texture assets and builds the scene from them. So an external tool
only has to emit (a) one JSON file that validates against the schema below and (b) the
image assets it references.

- **Schema (source of truth):** `shared/src/schemas/arena.ts`
- **Renderer:** `client/src/core/SceneBuilder.ts`
- **Shipped examples:** `content/arenas/ring-nebula.json`, `content/arenas/deep-field.json`

---

## 1. Coordinate system and units

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Handedness | Babylon default — **left-handed**, Y up |
| Axes | `x` right, `y` **up**, `z` forward |
| Unit | 1 unit ≈ 1 "space metre" in sim terms. The HUD multiplies displayed distances by `theme.hud.metersPerUnit` (currently `2`) for readability — that is display-only and never affects geometry |
| Angles | radians everywhere (`heading`, `pitch`, `rotation`) |
| Heading | rotation about **+Y**; `heading: 0` faces **+X**, increasing toward +Z |
| Pitch | nose elevation; positive = climbing. Constrained to `(-π/2, +π/2)` on spawn points |

Ships fly in a full 3D volume ("the bubble"), not on a plane. `y` is a real axis: a rock 20
units above the sight line does not block a shot, and an enemy overhead is genuinely
distant rather than co-located.

### The hard size limit ⚠️

Positions are replicated as **signed int16 in centi-units**, so **no coordinate may exceed
±327.67**. The schema enforces it, and pack validation additionally enforces
`extent + tuning.projectileBoundsMargin ≤ 327.67` (default margin `20`), because ordnance
flies past the rim before being culled.

**Practical ceiling for a generated map: a sphere of radius ~300, or a box whose half-extents
are ~300.** A builder should treat this as a hard constraint and refuse to export past it —
otherwise positions silently clamp and remote clients see ships pinned to an invisible wall.

---

## 2. The arena config

```jsonc
{
  "id": "arena.my-map",          // must start with "arena."
  "type": "arena",               // discriminator, always "arena"
  "version": 1,
  "name": "My Map",              // display name

  "bounds": { "shape": "sphere", "radius": 126 },

  "asteroidPlacements": [ /* see §3 */ ],
  "spawnPoints":        [ /* see §4 */ ],

  "lighting": { /* optional, see §5 */ },
  "render":   { /* optional but strongly recommended, see §6 */ }
}
```

Every config in this project shares the `id` / `type` / `version` / `name` envelope
(`shared/src/schemas/base.ts`). The `id` prefix must match the `type`.

### Bounds

Two shapes:

```jsonc
{ "shape": "sphere", "radius": 126 }

{ "shape": "rect", "width": 400, "height": 400, "verticalExtent": 160 }
```

- `sphere` is the normal case — a bubble. Boundary checks use true 3D radial distance.
- `rect` is a bounded box: `width` = x extent, `height` = **z** extent, `verticalExtent` = y
  extent. Note `height` is depth, not vertical — a legacy name.

What happens at the boundary is **not** a map property: it belongs to the gamemode
(`gamemode.boundaryRule` — bounce / damage / damageAndBounce / warning). The map only
declares the shape and how the boundary *looks* (§6).

---

## 3. Asteroids (the map's geometry)

```jsonc
"asteroidPlacements": [
  { "asteroidId": "asteroid.colossal-a", "position": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0 },
    "rotation": 0.7, "scale": 1.8 },
  { "asteroidId": "asteroid.large-hazard", "position": { "x": -40, "y": 12, "z": 25 } }
]
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `asteroidId` | references an existing `asteroid.*` config (see `content/asteroids/`) |
| `position` | `{x, y, z}`; `y` optional, defaults to `0` |
| `rotation` | optional yaw in radians |
| `scale` | optional uniform scale; **multiplies the asteroid's collider radius too** |

Asteroids are the only solid geometry. They:

- block line of sight (segment-vs-sphere in 3D),
- deal impact damage on collision,
- are the cover a dogfight uses.

**Collision is a sphere**, always — `asteroid.collider.radius × placement.scale`. A visually
irregular rock still collides as a ball, so a builder should keep meshes roughly convex or
accept that the visual and the collision differ.

**A generated map should not place rocks on top of spawn points.** The shipped-geometry test
(`shared/src/schemas/shippedArenaGeometry.test.ts`) requires ≥ 25 units of clearance between a
big centrepiece and any spawn pad, and generally checks that lanes between opposing spawns are
not fully walled off.

### Adding new asteroid *types*

A new rock type is its own config (`content/asteroids/*.json`) — radius, hp, destructible,
impact damage, and a render recipe. A map builder that invents new rock shapes must emit those
configs too, and register them in `content/manifest.json`.

---

## 4. Spawn points

```jsonc
"spawnPoints": [
  { "id": "sp-a1", "team": 0, "position": { "x": -57.8, "y": 10.5, "z": -57.8 }, "heading": 0.79 },
  { "id": "sp-b1", "team": 1, "position": { "x":  57.8, "y": -10.5, "z": 57.8 }, "heading": 3.93, "pitch": 0.1 }
]
```

- `team` is an integer; `0` is the player's side in practice modes, `1` the opposition.
- At least one spawn point is required, and **every spawn must sit inside `bounds`** (schema-enforced).
- Respawn picks a random pad belonging to the ship's team, so **author at least one clear pad per team slot**
  (the shipped 10v10 CTF mode has 10 per side), or initial spawns overlap and respawns become predictable.
- `heading` should point roughly toward the middle of the map — players spawn facing it.

---

## 5. Lighting

```jsonc
"lighting": {
  "ambientColor": "#1a2233",
  "ambientIntensity": 0.4,
  "directionalIntensity": 0.9
}
```

All optional. This is the *generic* rig. If the skybox declares a `sun` (§6) that sun replaces
the directional key light entirely — which is the better path, because then the lighting matches
the painted sky.

---

## 6. `render` — skybox and boundary shield

```jsonc
"render": {
  "skybox": {
    "texture": "skyboxes/ring-nebula.webp",
    "intensity": 0.92,
    "tint": "#e4e7ff",
    "sun": { "dir": [-0.677, -0.208, -0.706], "color": "#dce4ff", "intensity": 1.0 }
  },
  "boundaryShield": {
    "baseOpacity": 0.05,
    "glowStartDistance": 40,
    "redTransitionDistance": 16,
    "warnDistance": 22,
    "blueColor": "#45c8ff",
    "redColor": "#ff405c",
    "hexDensity": 42,
    "warningNotification": "notification.boundary-warning"
  }
}
```

### 6.1 Skybox

The sky is a **single equirectangular panorama** mapped onto an inward-facing sphere
(`sideOrientation: BACKSIDE`) with diameter `boundsRadius × 6`, centred on the arena.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `texture` | path **relative to `content/`**, served from `/content/…`. e.g. `skyboxes/ring-nebula.webp` |
| `intensity` | emissive multiplier (the texture's `level`) |
| `tint` | RGB tint **multiplied** into the panorama |
| `sun` | optional; promotes the star painted in the panorama to the real key light |

**Format for a generated panorama:**

- **Equirectangular / lat-long, 2:1 aspect** (e.g. 4096×2048). This is the standard panorama
  layout — *not* a 6-face cubemap cross, and not a cube-strip.
- **WebP** is what ships (`ring-nebula.webp`, `deep-field.webp`); JPEG works too (`Skybox01.jpg`).
  Prefer WebP for size. Keep it under a few MB — it is downloaded before the match starts and
  counts against the client bundle budget checked in CI.
- Seamless horizontally; the poles will be pinched (inherent to equirectangular) so avoid putting
  critical detail directly overhead or underfoot.

**The `sun` block is the important one for realism.** `dir` is a **unit vector pointing FROM the
arena TOWARD the star** — the same direction an author reads off the panorama. The renderer builds
a parallel-ray `DirectionalLight` travelling along `-dir`, so every lit surface faces back at the
painted star. The schema validates `|dir| ≈ 1` (tolerance `0.02`) precisely because a typo here is
otherwise very hard to spot.

> **For an external builder:** if your tool places a star/planet in the generated panorama, it
> already knows that direction — emit it as `sun.dir` and sample the star's colour into
> `sun.color`. That single step is the difference between "a nice backdrop" and "the scene is lit
> by the thing in the sky".

Notes on the shader, if you are matching the look in your own viewer: the material is a
`StandardMaterial` with `diffuseColor`/`specularColor`/**`emissiveColor` all black**, the panorama
on the *emissive* channel, `intensity` riding the texture's `level`, and the tint applied via an
emissive Fresnel with equal left/right colours. `emissiveColor` must stay black — the standard
shader **adds** emissive colour to the emissive texture rather than multiplying, so any non-black
value paints a flat wash over the whole sky.

Skybox rendering can be disabled by the quality tier (`quality.scene.skyboxEnabled`), so the map
must still be legible without it.

### 6.2 Boundary shield

The visible "wall" at the arena edge: an inward-facing shell that stays nearly invisible until you
approach, then brightens and shifts blue → red.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `baseOpacity` | opacity when far away (keep low — `0.05`) |
| `glowStartDistance` | distance *inside* the rim where it starts brightening |
| `redTransitionDistance` | distance inside the rim where blue starts blending to red |
| `warnDistance` | distance inside the rim that triggers the HUD warning |
| `blueColor` / `redColor` | the two shell colours |
| `hexDensity` | number of procedural hex cells around the shell |
| `warningNotification` | id of an existing `notification.*` config |

Scale these with the map: on a radius-126 arena the shipped values are `40 / 16 / 22`. On a much
bigger arena, raise `glowStartDistance` proportionally or players will hit the wall before it
becomes visible.

---

## 7. Assets: models and textures

### Where files live

```
content/
  manifest.json          ← every config file must be listed here
  arenas/*.json
  asteroids/*.json
  skyboxes/*.webp|*.jpg  ← panoramas
  models/… , ships/…     ← GLB meshes
```

`content/manifest.json` has a flat `files` array of config paths. **A config that is not in the
manifest does not exist** as far as the loader is concerned — this is the single most common
integration mistake. Texture/model assets are *not* listed there; they are referenced by path
from the configs that use them.

### GLB conventions

For any mesh (ships, asteroids, props):

- Export **forward as −Y in Blender**, which imports as **+Z in engine space**.
- **Normalise the asset to one unit of forward extent**, then use `modelScale` in the render recipe
  for its real size. Keeps scale a data decision rather than a re-export.
- `modelRotationY` is a radians yaw correction if the export is off-axis.
- Fully metallic PBR materials are clamped by the engine so they stay lit without an environment map.

---

## 8. Validation and importing

Run the content gate — it validates every config against its schema **and** cross-checks
references (a placement pointing at a non-existent `asteroid.*`, a `warningNotification` naming a
missing notification, etc.):

```bash
npm run validate:content
```

It prints a per-type count on success. Additional map-specific checks live in
`shared/src/schemas/shippedArenaGeometry.test.ts` (spawn clearance, extents, corridors).

**Import checklist for a generated map:**

1. Drop the panorama into `content/skyboxes/`.
2. Drop any new mesh into the appropriate `content/` subfolder.
3. Write `content/arenas/<name>.json`.
4. Write any new `content/asteroids/<name>.json` types it needs.
5. Add every new **config** path to `content/manifest.json`.
6. Point a gamemode at it via `gamemode.defaultArena`, or pass the arena id when starting a match.
7. `npm run validate:content`, then `npx vitest run`.

---

## 9. What a map does *not* control

Worth knowing so a builder does not try to emit it:

| Concern | Lives in |
|---|---|
| Boundary behaviour (bounce/damage) | `gamemode.boundaryRule` |
| Team sizes, win conditions, respawn | `gamemode.*` |
| Bot rosters | `gamemode.bots` |
| HUD colours, menu look, `metersPerUnit` | `theme.*` |
| Ship/module stats | `ship.*`, `module.*` |
| Global damage/lock multipliers, tick rate | `tuning.*` |
| Quality tiers (incl. whether the skybox renders) | `quality.*` |

A map is: **bounds + rocks + spawns + sky + boundary look.** Nothing else.
